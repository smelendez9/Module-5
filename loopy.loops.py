# In the first file, called loopy_loops.py do the following:

# Create a tuple named pokemon that holds the strings 'picachu', 'charmander', and 'bulbasaur'.
# Using index notation, print() the string that located at index 1 in pokemon
# Unpack the values of pokemon into the following three new variables with names starter1, starter2, starter3.
# Create a tuple using the tuple() built-in, that contains the letters of your name.
# Check whether the character i is in your tuple representation of your name.
# Write a for loop that prints out the integers 2 through 10, each on a new line, by using the range() function.
# Use a while loop that prints out the integers 2 through 10.
# Write a for loop that iterates over the string 'This is a simple string' and prints each character.
# Using a nested for loop, iterate over the following set ('this', 'is', 'a', 'simple', 'set') and print each word, three times.
